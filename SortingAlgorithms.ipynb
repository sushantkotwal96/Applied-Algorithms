    "1. Here we are using Radix Sort for sorting an array D on n integers in range(0,n^2-1). The radix sort sorts the list in O(n)      time.\n",
    "2. The other algorithms like Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Heap Sort sort the list in O(n^2) , O(nlogn) and O(nlogn) time          respectively. Hence Radix Sort is better compared to these algorithms\n",
    "3. Radix Sort sorts each digit first by it's least significant digit i.e units digit till it's most significant digit.\n",
    "4. It is a stable sorting algorithm which uses the counting sort for sorting elements according to significance of digits. The      complexity of Counting sort is O(n+k) where k is the maximum range of numbers which are to be sorted.\n",
    "5. For radix sort, we call the method d times where d is the number of digits in the maximum number of the list. Generally we represent radix sort by the formula O(d(n+b)) where b is the base of the number e.g. b=10 for decimal system. \n",
    "6. We have to sort for range[0,n^2-1] from the above question. Here b is the maximum digits which a number has\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Therefore by the formula for calculating d,\n",
    "   d = floor(log10(b))+ 1      (log10(b) is log b to the base 10)\n",
    "   For maximum value n^2-1, d would be:\n",
    "   d = floor(log10(n))+ 1\n",
    "   \n",
    "   So substituting d in O(d(n+b)), we get:\n",
    "   O(floor(log10(n))*(n+b))\n",
    "    \n",
    "   To get the complexity as O(n) for the above, we take value of b as n so O(logb(n)) equates to O(1)\n",
